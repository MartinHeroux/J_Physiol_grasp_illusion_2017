## DATA

Data have been imported for each subject, stored in a table and saved as a comma-seperated values in a plain text file.

Data files
----------
**exp1_data.txt**

 Data for experiment 1. File contains headers and column 1 is the index column (i.e. subject number).

**exp2_data.txt**

Data for experiment 2. File contains headers and column 1 is the index column (i.e. subject number).


## CODE FILES
All code was writen in Python by Martin Héroux. Code has been tested with Python 3.4 and should be forward compatible.

Python version
--------------

Python version: Python 3.5.2. 

Additional Python packages: 
                            
    matplotplib 1.5.3
	numpy 1.11.1					
	pandas 0.18.1

Python files
------------

**cumming_plot.py**

A Python module used to generate figures. The full project can be found [here](https://github.com/MartinHeroux/cumming_plot) on github. The included version can be cited as:
